Your radio crackles to a loud screech and then silence.... a faint voice could be heard, it's Eleven. Help.. I've closed a portal at the lake and my power is fadi... radio silence. Someone needs to bike towards the lake, the other gets the group together. A crudely Tic-Tac-Toe outline is drawn, it's a best out of 3!
